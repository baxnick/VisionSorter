The subrepositories are as follows:

ARToolKitPlusTracker
   Contains a modified version of the tracker plugin, with some bugfixes and change from simple to BCH markers

helpful
   Contains files will probably be useful. In particular, it contains a file with all required includes and libraries

magicker
   Contains ruby scripts that can prepare markers from the bch directory for printing, either directly to a sheet of paper or as a cube

physorc
   Contains my physical and orchestration layers. It runs as an Eclipse project.

scripts
   Contains helper scripts at the least, you will probably need pathConfig.sh and run_config.sh after tailoring them for your system

vision
   Contains the VisionSystem that handles pose recognition/ball finding. It is written in C++ and is a separate component.


Dependencies:

You will want your distribution versions of GStreamer, OpenCV, and Boost.
If it does not include these, you will have to compile them yourself, but they are widely available.
You may need additional software in order to interface with your webcam.

You will also need LCM and Lejos. You may have to change the Eclipse project paths to reflect their installed locations.

Getting started:

As a barebones install, you will need -
   helpful (for libs.tar.gz)
   scripts (for pathConfig.sh and run_config.sh)
   physorc, and
   vision

You can have these repositories wherever you like.
However, you will need to extract libs.tar.gz and update pathConfig.sh to reflect the extracted path.
That is, unless you have managed to get all these outdated libraries compiled on your own system.

helpful / scripts work together to support vision. physorc stands alone in it's own right.
See the respective subrepository README files for further information.
